Background
---------------

The OSULP Civility Committee printed 500 unique kindness cards (available at all main floor service desks). Users could take as many cards as they would like to distribute, gave out cards to people who did something kind, thoughtful, nice, or genuinely sweet. The receiver could scan the unique QR code on the back and enter their location and why they received the card. Then they would PASS IT ON! The goal was to see how far around the globe each card could travel - akin to the Where's George program for $1 bills.  

The Civility Tracker is a Rails application that allows for the public display of the unique kindness cards. Users will be able to view a map of the world where the card was scanned in with a brief summary of the act of kindness. The Civility Tracker was live from January 2016 through Summer 2016. 

Members of the Civility Committee exhibited a poster on this project at the Oregon Library Association Meeting in 2016. You can find that poster here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B46y0irXtELNVXJpa2tydTVXbGs/view?usp=sharing
